# Site-Dictionary-Attack
A python script made to bruteforce every single word in the english dictionary on a site folder, and then log the results on Discord.

# Implementing custom words
To implement custom words, open up "other_words.txt" in any text editor and then add your words, seperating them using a comma and a space.

# How to protect your site/webpuzzle against this tool
This tool works by checking 200,000 english words and seeing if they are a valid link. If you want to protect your site against this tool, do NOT name your web directory after an english word.
